# **Description**
Website #2 is the 2nd website-project I've created, built by implementing HTML5, CSS3, & JavaScript (If you haven't seen the first one, [click here](https://github.com/Paul-Nixon/Website-1)).

Website #2 was created with the intent to implement JavaScript in some way. Therefore, I mainly focused on creating store.html. Concerning the format of the other webpages' main sections and the header and footer, in hindsight, all of them could have definitely been improved visual-wise, but mental fatigue/stress took its toll. That doesn't completely justify my work-ethic & thought-process mid-development, but let's not act like fatigue doesn't affect productivity. Regardless, I hope anyone who views this notices I put some effort into this project.<br></br>
